# Introduction

![](images/generic_toyota.jpg)

Buying a car is a major investment and a big deal in society. Buying a new car is generally a great bet in making sure the car is in prime shape, and pristine condition.  Nevertheless, buying a new car generally means incurring a high initial depreciation cost immediately on driving the car out of the dealership. In 2016, there were approximatley 59.4 million cars 71% being used cars (*ref 1).  The purpose of this excersise is to explain the eBay Germany market price using available explainatory variables provided, while creating a model that can be used for prediction.

# Data Description

The data was downloaded from kaggle "Used cars database, Over 370,000 used cars scraped from Ebay Kleinanzeigen" at  https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database.  These are prices listed for cars and not the final price.  In this case, for cleansing data, only fixed price listings were kept while auctions deleted, especially as some listers will drop the price low and not sell unless the price hits a certain threshhold.  Cleansing details are in a table in the Appendix.

``` {r data, echo=FALSE}
<<dataimport>>
#head(dfm_AutoData, n = 2)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Using price as the response variable, the available list of other usable attrubutes of interest include: price, vehicleType, yearOfRegistration, gearbox, powerPS, model, kilometer, fuelType, brand, notRepairedDamage.  Other attributes were not deemed significant for the model as follows:

- DateCrawled and dateCreated indicated the information was generally from 1st half of 2016.
- Name, seller, abtest, and offerType do not have any logical meaning in this context.
- monthOfRegistration may or may not have an impact, but logically speacking, when shopping for a used car, people are less interested in this attribute.

Initally looking into the effect of the variables against each other and price, the following scatter plot basically shows that at least price needs to be logged when comparing to a large selection especially due to the big difference in price differences as a very few cars were extreme outliers in that respect as shown with the following histograms:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
#<<histogram_plots>>
img_histo <- readPNG("pre-generated/histogram_plots.png")
grid.raster(img_histo)
```

The the scatter plots below compare a selection of factors, logically speaking there seems to be very few visual co-dependencies between the other explanatory variables, but there does show to be an obvious linear trend with price are Kilometer, YearOfRegistration and powerPS, though some of the other may have a correlation also.

``` {r fig.width=5, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
img2 <- readPNG("pre-generated/Rplot5.png")
grid.raster(img2)
```
``` {r  fig.width=5, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
img2 <- readPNG("pre-generated/Rplot06.png")
grid.raster(img2)
```

As an observation, due to the fact that car prices can vary widely due to brand and model (meaning a luxury brand car with more kilometers can still cost more than a cheaper car with almost no kilometers), the only way to really get a sense of the linearity of kilometers is to break down the car type all the way to a specific model, brand, and year and in some cases type (for the ones that have a limosine configuration).

``` {r explore, echo=FALSE}
#<<explore_data_plots>>
img_explore <- readPNG("pre-generated/explore_plots.png")
grid.raster(img_explore)
```

As per the analysis, the variables that seem most viable to start off with for a rich model are log(price) = B0(kilometer) +  B1(brand) + B2 (model) + B3(vehicleType) + B4(yearOfRegistration) + B5(PowerPS) +B6(fuelType) starting off without the interactions.

# Objective 1: Regression

QOI: Car Pricing is heaviy impacted by kilometer, brand, model, vehicleType, and yearOfRegistration.  With our current "RICH" model we want to do a general linear regression initially, then run four different automatic variable selecting techniques including stepwise, forward, & LASSO.  After Variable selection we want to perform cross validation to ensure the best model.  Below is a look at the model plots:

## Regression Model Selections

### Simple Fits Regression

First are just some quick and easy simple fit models of price and one or more explanatory variables for illustration and infromational purposes:

``` {r simplefit, fig.width=6, fig.height=2, echo=FALSE}
<<reg_setup>>
<<reg_simplefits>>
#<<reg_simplefits_plots>>
img_rich <- readPNG("pre-generated/simplefits_plots.png")
grid.raster(img_rich)
```

### Rich Model Regression

This is the initial "rich" Fit model without auto variable selection for the fit model seleciton: log(price) = B0(kilometer) +  B1(brand) + B2 (model) + B3(vehicleType) + B4(yearOfRegistration) + B5(PowerPS) + B6(fuelType):

``` {r richfit, echo=FALSE}
#<<reg_richfit>>
#img_rich <- readPNG("pre-generated/rich_fit_plots.png")
#grid.raster(img_rich)
```

As per assumptions:
-1- There is no evidence of a viloation of normality.
-2- Though the residual plot is very full due to all of the points, variance does look constant, showing no evidence of any violations.
-3- As per how the data was collected and the type of data, the assumption is that there is no inherent violation of independence.

### Stepwise, MLR_FORWARD, and LASSO on Rich Model Regression

``` {r stepwise, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
#<<reg_stepwise>>
#<<reg_richfit_mlrfor>>
```

The stepwise implementation in R results in the same model as the previous Rich Fit model, while the MLR_FOR implementation seems to have something that is worse than rich fit and LASSO does not seem to work at all with the data set.

### Complex Model Regression

In this case there is an extra interaction with kilometer with the other explanatory variabes (log(price)~kilometer + brand + model + vehicleType + yearOfRegistration + powerPS + fuelType + kilometer:brand + kilometer:model + kilometer:vehicleType + kilometer:yearOfRegistration + yearOfRegistration:vehicleType):

``` {r complex, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
<<reg_complexfit>>
img_complex <- readPNG("pre-generated/complex_fit_plots.png")
grid.raster(img_complex)
```

### Stepwise on Complex Model Regression

``` {r complex_stepwise, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
#<<reg_complex_stepwise>>
```

The implementation in R results in the same model as the previous Complex Fit model.

## Model Comparisons

``` {r dataframe, echo=FALSE}
print.data.frame(dfm_model_comparisons)
```
