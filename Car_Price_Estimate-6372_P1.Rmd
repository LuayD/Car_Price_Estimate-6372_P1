# Introduction

![](images/generic_toyota.jpg)

Buying a car is a major investment and a big deal in society. Buying a new car is generally a great bet in making sure the car is in prime shape, and pristine condition.  Nevertheless, buying a new car generally means incurring a high initial depreciation cost immediately on driving the car out of the dealership. In 2016, there were approximatley 59.4 million cars 71% being used cars (*ref 1).  The purpose of this excersise is to explain the eBay Germany market price using available explainatory variables provided, while creating a model that can be used for prediction.

# Data Description

The data was downloaded from kaggle "Used cars database, Over 370,000 used cars scraped from Ebay Kleinanzeigen" at  https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database.  These are prices listed for cars and not the final price.  In this case, for cleansing data, only fixed price listings were kept while auctions deleted, especially as some listers will drop the price low and not sell unless the price hits a certain threshhold.  Cleansing details are in a table in the Appendix.

``` {r data, echo=FALSE}
<<dataimport>>
#head(dfm_AutoData, n = 2)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

As per the plots... Price is an interesting Explanatory Variable as below:

``` {r fig.width=4, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("pre-generated/Rplot01.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

``` {r fig.width=4, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
img2 <- readPNG("pre-generated/Rplot5.png")
grid.raster(img2)
#<<explore_data_plots>>
#<<histogram_plots>>
```

``` {r fig.width=3, fig.height=3, echo=FALSE}
<<explore_data_plots>>
<<histogram_plots>>
```

Assumptions:
1- Normality
2- Variance
3- Deviation
