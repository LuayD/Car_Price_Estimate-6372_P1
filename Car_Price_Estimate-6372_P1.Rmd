# Introduction

![](images/generic_toyota.jpg)

Buying a car is a major investment and a big deal in society. Buying a new car is generally a great bet in making sure the car is in prime shape, and pristine condition.  Nevertheless, buying a new car generally means incurring a high initial depreciation cost immediately on driving the car out of the dealership. In 2016, there were approximatley 59.4 million cars 71% being used cars (*ref 1).  

## QOI: The purpose of this excersise is to explain the eBay Germany market price using available explainatory variables provided, while creating a model that can be used for prediction. Hypothesis: though there are multiple variables in the eBay dataset, we beleive that the prices can be pedicted accuratly by using the specific varaibes describing: KM, year of registration, power( in PS), brand, model, vehicle type, and fuel type.

# Data Description

The data was downloaded from kaggle "Used cars database, Over 370,000 used cars scraped from Ebay Kleinanzeigen" at  https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database.  These are prices listed for cars and not the final price.  In this case, for cleansing data, only fixed price listings were kept while auctions deleted, especially as some listers will drop the price low and not sell unless the price hits a certain threshhold.  Cleansing details are in a table in the Appendix.

``` {r data, echo=FALSE}
<<dataimport>>
#head(dfm_AutoData, n = 2)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Using price as the response variable, the available list of other usable attrubutes of interest include: price, vehicleType, yearOfRegistration, gearbox, powerPS, model, kilometer, fuelType, brand, notRepairedDamage.  Other attributes were not deemed significant for the model as follows:

- DateCrawled and dateCreated indicated the information was generally from 1st half of 2016.
- Name, seller, abtest, and offerType do not have any logical meaning in this context.
- monthOfRegistration may or may not have an impact, but logically speacking, when shopping for a used car, people are less interested in this attribute.

Initally looking into the effect of the variables against each other and price, the following scatter plot basically shows that at least price needs to be logged when comparing to a large selection especially due to the big difference in price differences as a very few cars were extreme outliers in that respect as shown with the following histograms:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
#<<histogram_plots>>
img_histo <- readPNG("pre-generated/histogram_plots.png")
grid.raster(img_histo)
```

The the scatter plots below compare a selection of factors, logically speaking there seems to be very few visual co-dependencies between the other explanatory variables, but there does show to be an obvious linear trend with price are Kilometer, YearOfRegistration and powerPS, though some of the other may have a correlation also.

``` {r fig.width=5, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
img2 <- readPNG("pre-generated/Rplot5.png")
grid.raster(img2)
```
``` {r  fig.width=5, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE}
img2 <- readPNG("pre-generated/Rplot06.png")
grid.raster(img2)
```

As an observation, due to the fact that car prices can vary widely due to brand and model (meaning a luxury brand car with more kilometers can still cost more than a cheaper car with almost no kilometers), the only way to really get a sense of the linearity of kilometers is to break down the car type all the way to a specific model, brand, and year and in some cases type (for the ones that have a limosine configuration).

``` {r explore, echo=FALSE}
#<<explore_data_plots>>
img_explore <- readPNG("pre-generated/explore_plots.png")
grid.raster(img_explore)
```

As per the analysis, the variables that seem most viable to start off with for a rich model are log(price) = B0(kilometer) +  B1(brand) + B2 (model) + B3(vehicleType) + B4(yearOfRegistration) + B5(PowerPS) +B6(fuelType) starting off without the interactions.

# Objective 1: Regression

QOI: Car Pricing is heaviy impacted by kilometer, brand, model, vehicleType, and yearOfRegistration.  With our current "RICH" model we want to do a general linear regression initially, then run four different automatic variable selecting techniques including stepwise, forward, & LASSO.  After Variable selection we want to perform cross validation to ensure the best model.  Below is a look at the model plots:

## Regression Model Selections

### Simple Fits Regression

First are just some quick and easy simple fit models of price and one or more explanatory variables for illustration and infromational purposes:

``` {r simplefit, fig.width=6, fig.height=2, echo=FALSE}
<<reg_setup>>
<<reg_simplefits>>
#<<reg_simplefits_plots>>
img_rich <- readPNG("pre-generated/simplefits_plots.png")
grid.raster(img_rich)
```

### Rich Model Regression

This is the initial "rich" Fit model without auto variable selection for the fit model seleciton: log(price) = B0(kilometer) +  B1(brand) + B2 (model) + B3(vehicleType) + B4(yearOfRegistration) + B5(PowerPS) + B6(fuelType):

``` {r richfit, echo=FALSE}
<<reg_richfit>>
img_rich <- readPNG("pre-generated/rich_fit_plots.png")
grid.raster(img_rich)
```

As per assumptions:
####-1- There is no evidence of a viloation of normality.
####-2- Though the residual plot is very full due to all of the points, variance does look constant, showing no evidence of any violations.
####-3- As per how the data was collected and the type of data, the assumption is that there is no inherent violation of independence.

### Stepwise, MLR_FORWARD, and LASSO on Rich Model Regression

``` {r stepwise, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
<<reg_stepwise>>
<<reg_richfit_mlrfor>>
```

The stepwise implementation in R results in the same model as the previous Rich Fit model, while the MLR_FOR implementation seems to have something that is worse than rich fit and LASSO does not seem to work at all with the data set.  NOTE, though not included, I also ran a forward and backward auto variable selection and came up with the same results.

### Complex Model Regression

In this case there is an extra interaction with kilometer with the other explanatory variabes (log(price)~kilometer + brand + model + vehicleType + yearOfRegistration + powerPS + fuelType + kilometer:brand + kilometer:model + kilometer:vehicleType + kilometer:yearOfRegistration + yearOfRegistration:vehicleType):

``` {r complex, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
<<reg_complexfit>>
img_complex <- readPNG("pre-generated/complex_fit_plots.png")
grid.raster(img_complex)
```

### Reduced Model Regression

For the purpose of easier interpretation, we want to use the following reduced model (log(price)~kilometer + vehicleType + yearOfRegistration + powerPS + fuelType):

``` {r reduced, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
<<reg_reducedfit>>
img_complex <- readPNG("pre-generated/Rplot_reduced.png")
grid.raster(img_complex)
```

## Model Comparisons

``` {r dataframe, echo=FALSE}
print.data.frame(dfm_model_comparisons)
```

## Parameter Interpretation

After comparing models, the "complex model" had the best Adjusted R^2, Lowest AIC, and a good testMSE on the test data.  This one is the best in terms of using prediction.  The complex model's equation is as follows:

$$ log(Price) = \beta_0+\beta_1(kilometer)+\beta_2(brand)+\beta_3(model)+\beta_4(vehicleType)+\beta_5(yearOfRegistration)+\beta_6(powerPs)+\beta_7(fuelType)+\beta_8(kilometer*brand)+\beta_9(kilometer*model)+\beta_10(kilometer*vehicleType)+\beta_11(kilometer*yearOfRegistration)+\beta_12(yearOfRegistration*vehicleType)  $$

Nevertheless, this model is too complex for practical interpretation, so for the purposes of interpretation, the "reduced model" without interactions for interpretations as follows:

$$ log(Price) = \beta_0+\beta_1(kilometer)+\beta_2(vehicleType)+\beta_3(yearOfRegistration)+\beta_4(powerPs)+\beta_5(fuelType)  $$

``` {r datatable, echo=FALSE}
sum_lm_reducedmodel <- summary(lm_reducedmodel)
mat_temp <- coef(sum_lm_reducedmodel)
dfm_table <- as.data.frame(mat_temp)
dfm_table$ci25 <- confint(lm_reducedmodel)[,1]
dfm_table$ci975 <- confint(lm_reducedmodel)[,2]
print.data.frame(dfm_table)
```

####Intercept: This is the value of the log(sale price) of the car when there are no kilometers, vehicle type is other (andere), year of registration and powerPs are 0, and the fuel type is other (andere).  So the initial intercept when all explanatory variable are 0, is e^(-1.057e+02).  This is impracical in multiple ways including that the intercept is vary small, and other variables like Year Of Registration would not be zero.

####kilometer: The data suggests that each increase of 1 KM is associated with a decrease in the median price a factor of e^-9.258e-06 = 0.9999907. That is, the median y at each value of x is only 0.9999907 of the median y at 1 less unit of x. In other words, a one unit increase in km is associated with a 0.0000093% decrease in median price.

####Vehicle type: This is a factor representing the type of vehicle.  In this scenario, if all other variables are constant, this would indicate the differences in price from the intercept for the following vehicles types from the base type:
#####0 Case, this is the case where the fuel type is not listed or blank and is equivalent to the intercept.
#####andere: (other): e^(8.932e-01) or 2.442935 Euros (basically 0) addition to the intercept
#####bus: e^(1.052e+00) or 2.863372 Euros (basically 0) addition to the intercept
#####carbio: e^(1.522e+00) or 4.581379 Euros addition to the intercept
#####coupe: e^(1.291e+00) or 3.636857 Euros addition to the intercept
#####kleinwagen: e^(6.245e-01) or 1.867306 Euros addition to the intercept
#####kombi: e^(8.359e-01) or 2.306967 Euros addition to the intercept
#####limousine: e^(9.784e-01) or 2.660152 Euros addition to the intercept
#####suv: e^(1.300e+00) or 3.67005 Euros addition to the intercept

#####Year of Registration: The data suggests that each increase of 1 year, there is an associated incease in the median price a factor of e^(5.647795e-02) or 1.058103

#####powerPS: The data suggests that each increase of 1 PS (German equivalent of Horse Power), there is an associated incease in the median price a factor of e^(The data suggests that each increase of 1 year, there is an associated incease in the median price a factor of e^(5.291870e-03	) or 1.005306

####Fuel type: The type of fuel used but the car. In this scenario, if all other variables are constant, this would indicate the differences in price from the intercept for the following fuel types from the base type:
#####fuelTypeandere	e^1.078627e-01 or 1.113895 Euros addition to the intercept
#####fuelTypebenzin	e^1.303647e-01 or 1.139244 Euros addition to the intercept
#####fuelTypecng	e^2.695258e-01 or	1.309343 Euros addition to the intercept
#####fuelTypediesel	e^6.477671e-01 or	1.911268 Euros addition to the intercept
#####fuelTypeelektro	e^3.551691e-01 or	1.426422 Euros addition to the intercept
#####fuelTypehybrid	e^6.386692e-01 or	1.893959 Euros addition to the intercept
#####fuelTypelpg	e^2.099529e-01 or 1.233620 Euros addition to the intercept

## Conclusions


# Objective 2: Two-Way ANOVA

QOI: Goal

## Main Analysis
We are interested in a number of questions related to categorical variables. First, whether there is a difference in price for different types of gearbox (manual or automatic) and whether the fuel type has any bearing on price.

```{r anova, echo=FALSE}
# TODO: separate out the graphs
<<anova_comparisons>>
```
The results indicates that there is indeed a significant difference (p < 0.05) between each group, especially based on type of gear box. Surprisingly, price for fuel type sees a significant difference (p < 0.05) but has a less pronounced F value. The question is what this might mean.

```{r}
<<anova_boxplots>>
```
After creating a boxplot of type of gearbox, it appears that there is not an even distribution of the data. Just a few outliers may be affecting the results. So it seems important to check to see if the statistically significant result holds following a log transformation.

```{r}
<<anova_log>>
```
The result appears to be more pronounced, rather than less pronounced.

```{r}
<<anova_log_gearbox>>
```

```{r}
<<anova_log_fueltype>>
```
These distributions make it appear that there may not be a practically significant
difference between different groups. While the median result appears to be different
between the groups, the distributions seem to be wide, and in some cases to be 
significantly skewed.

```{r}
